# IDEs Java

## About Java

- object oriented
- interpreted language (needs compiler)
- in the language is compiled to a bytecode that is interpreted by a virtual machine (JVM)
- the programming language is the conventional language, but it is not the only language.
- the platform is NOT tied to an OS or HW, as the programs run through a JVM that can be emulated -> "Write once, run anywhere".
- **Java platform divisions**:
  - **Java SE Java Platform, Standard Edition** -> Platform Base
  - **Java EE Enterprise Edition** -> web development
  - **Java ME Micro Edition** -> mobiles and embedded systems (calculator, remote control...)
- **Java execution phases:**
  - write the source code (.java)
  - JDK compiles the code and generates the bytecode (.class) file
  - JVM reads the compiled file (.class) and the standard Java libraries that are in the JRE.
    - JDK Java Development Kit
    - JVM Java Virtual Machine
    - JRE Java Runtime Environment
